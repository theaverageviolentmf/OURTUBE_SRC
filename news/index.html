    Well, it looks like I couldn't reach any funding goals. So I'm handing it over to HundredNulls (Reputable search engine) and their infrasructure is taking place in a few months, already begun to add a few of their desired features. While this doesn't mean that I won't be a part of the project, it does mean that I will not be making any of the features that you people want, or that I want. The comment feature is probably getting delayed until 2026, fucking crazy this is.
